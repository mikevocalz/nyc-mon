 * Drag-to-resize affordance between the leading pane and its neighbour.
 *
 * GESTURE ARBITRATION.
 * There is nothing to arbitrate against by construction: the split view has no
 * other horizontal recognizer — collapse is derived from the window size class
 * and column stepping comes from Back — and this pan is confined to the
 * divider's own hit area, which is disjoint from the detail pane where the
 * calendar's horizontal scroll lives. Two recognizers that can never receive
 * the same pointer do not need a race.
 *
 * The one rule that keeps it that way: this divider must NOT grow its hit slop
 * into the detail pane. If it ever needs a wider target, the pan has to be
 * composed against the calendar's scroll with `useCompetingGestures` and the
 * arbitration written down here, because at that point they genuinely do
 * compete for the same pointer.
 *
 * API note: Gesture Handler 2.x (the version Expo SDK 57 pins), so this is the
 * builder API — `Gesture.Pan()` + `GestureDetector`, composed with
 * `Gesture.Race()`/`Gesture.Simultaneous()` if it ever needs to be. GH 3.x
 * deprecates the builder in favour of `usePanGesture` and the `use*Gestures`
 * hooks; revisit if the SDK moves forward again.
 *
 * Justified grep exception: `.runOnJS(true)` below is gesture-handler's
 * builder config (run this gesture's callbacks on the JS thread), not
 * Reanimated's deprecated runOnJS function. The handler writes to a Zustand
 * store, which is not worklet-safe, and the resize is a low-frequency drag, so
 * keeping it on the JS thread beats hopping threads with scheduleOnRN per frame.
