# Third-party notices

`@reactvision/viro-web-renderer` is MIT (see `LICENSE`). The package also ships
prebuilt binaries — `wasm/viro-web.*` and the tinyvio tracking engine under
`slam/` — that contain code from the projects below, and a font baked into
`wasm/viro-web.data`. tinyvio is ReactVision's
own and MIT-licensed, with no third-party code in its core; everything listed
here is linked into the renderer. Those projects' licences permit
redistribution and require that their notices travel with the binary, which is
what this file is for.

Nothing here restricts your use of this package beyond the MIT licence. The
obligations are notice obligations, and they are met by keeping this file with
the package.

## Roboto

The typeface every text geometry renders in, baked into `wasm/viro-web.data`
and therefore redistributed with this package. Roboto is also what Viro renders
text in on Android and Quest, so the three agree.
