/**
 * Drag-to-reschedule (native).
 *
 * Uses react-native-gesture-handler, NOT expo-drag-drop-content-view — the
 * latter is OS-level content drag-and-drop for moving files across app
 * boundaries (what DropZone uses) and cannot reposition a view in our own UI.
 *
 * SMOOTHNESS, and why the first version was not:
 *
 *  - The gesture is `useMemo`'d. Gesture Handler v2 re-attaches the recognizer
 *    whenever the gesture object identity changes, so an un-memoised
 *    `Gesture.Pan()` rebuilt on every render tore itself down mid-drag.
 *  - The drag drives a Reanimated shared value on the UI thread. The previous
 *    version ran the gesture on the JS thread and wrote the Zustand store per frame,
 *    which re-rendered the whole grid per pointer move — that is the jank.
 *  - The store is written exactly ONCE, on release, via `scheduleOnRN`. Gesture
 *    callbacks are workletized when Reanimated is installed, so calling a
 *    JS-thread function straight from one crashes; `scheduleOnRN` is the bridge.
 *
 * This wrapper owns the block's absolute position so the animated transform has
 * something to move. EventBlock fills it (`absolute inset-0`) rather than
 * positioning itself — a plain wrapper would become the containing block and
 * break the absolute layout.
