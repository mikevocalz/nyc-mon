 * A YouTube video, rendered where the link sits in a note.
 *
 * `react-native-youtube-bridge` drives the IFrame Player API through a WebView,
 * so the player is YouTube's own — which is what its terms require, and what
 * gives captions, quality selection and the watch-later affordances for free.
 *
 * 16:9 because that is what YouTube serves; a fixed height would letterbox on
 * one pane width and crop on another, and this player appears at several widths
 * (a note in a detail pane, a note in a full-screen editor).
