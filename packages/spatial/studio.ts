 * On native the Expo config plugin bakes the same pair into the manifest for
 * `VRTStudioModule`, so `StudioSceneNavigator` needs no props to fetch. On web
 * there is no manifest; the fetch in `StudioExperience.web` sends the same
 * `x-api-key` header the native module sends.
 *
 * `studioConfigured` is false until both values exist, and callers render the
 * code-first scene in that case — Studio content is additive, never the only
 * way a scene exists.
