 * COMPOSED, NOT A `searchable` FLAG — deliberately. A boolean on the pane would
 * make the pane own the placeholder, the result count and the field's position
 * in its own header, none of which the split view can know. Composition also
 * gives the brief's "no layout space when absent" for free: a pane that does
 * not render this has nothing to reserve, so it is byte-identical to a pane
 * that never had the option, rather than relying on a conditional collapsing to
 * exactly zero height.
 *
 * DEBOUNCE IS OWNED HERE, not delegated to the kit's SearchBar. That component
 * debounces `onChangeText` and keeps the instant text in its own internal
 * store, which would hand this callback the DELAYED value — so the store's
 * draft would lag the field and Back could not clear a query typed within the
 * debounce window. Driving the field from the store (`value={draft}`) keeps the
 * echo instant, since the store updates on every keystroke, and the debounce
 * applies only to `query`, which is what consumers filter on.
