      CHROME ON THE WRAPPER, TEXT IN THE NATIVE VIEW.

      The border, radius, background and padding cannot live on the Host: with
      `matchContents.vertical` the Host measures the NATIVE text and collapses
      to its line height, so the padding is swallowed and the border ends up
      hugging the glyphs — a thin outline with the caret sitting on the frame,
      next to controls that are all chunky slabs.

      So the resolved className style dresses a plain View, and the Host inside
      carries nothing but the editing surface. matchContents stays per-axis:
      vertical so the field is as tall as its text, horizontal off so it fills
      the width the wrapper gives it.
